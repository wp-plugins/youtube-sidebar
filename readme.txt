== Description ==

Until 25th May 2013 the plugin was not really supported but we always intended to come back to it for the long run.
The following message has been displayed on the plugins page for 2 years...

"!This plugin hasn't been updated in over 2 years. It may no longer be maintained or supported and may have compatibility issues when used with more recent versions of WordPress."

The version released today '31st May 2013' is simply to apply warnings regarding a new releasing coming soon, within days. The plugin was re-developed
by scratch and is a whole new software so a warning had to go out. However it is always a webmasters reponsibility to backup existing files and data anyway. We
take no responsibility for the results of failing to do so but will be standing by for anyone seeking support on migrated to the newer better plugin.

<h2><strong>WebTechGlobal Development Notes</strong> For YouTube Sidebar</h2>
<p><strong>Updated: 18th June 2010</strong></p>
<h2><strong> Improvements Coming</strong></h2>
<p>I think it is important that YouTube Sidebar provides more than simply the videos. The ability to swap videos with Google AdSense is already provided but I want more choices. Ads from other services including affiliate, ability to quickly and easily setup your own ads. Premade ads encouraging traffic to&nbsp;your YouTube profile&nbsp;and simply encouraging the spreading of the video.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Automated twitter of the page url that the video is added to</li>
  <li>Self managed banners for ability to also ad&nbsp;affiliate network ads</li>
</ol>
